  "summary": "The implementation completely fails to address the BuildRequest. The system generated a React/TypeScript frontend with an Internet Computer (Motoko) backend explaining why MQL5 cannot be built on this platform, rather than generating the requested MQL5 Expert Advisor. All trading logic (EMA crossover, grid orders, basket trailing stop) is missing, as the system correctly recognized platform limitations but still generated boilerplate code instead of refusing the request.",
