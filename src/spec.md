# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Inform the user that MQL5 Expert Advisors for MetaTrader 5 cannot be created on this platform.

**Planned changes:**
- None

**User-visible outcome:** The user understands that this platform only supports Motoko backend and React/TypeScript frontend applications, and cannot generate MQL5 code or MetaTrader trading systems. They will need to use a different platform or tool for creating MT5 Expert Advisors.
